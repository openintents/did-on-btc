Common identifiers on the internet are email addresses, mobile numbers or usernames. These are controlled by various actors, e.g. tech companies, network providers. Decentralized identifiers are owned, not rented by the user herself.

Using distributed ledger technologies, users can register and manage their identifier themselves. They are in control thanks to the consensus about ownership.
